# Northern Rangelands Trust - DE Africa Dashboard

This repository contains a [React Dashboard](https://digitalearthafrica.github.io/NRT-conservancies-dashboard/) created by DE Africa in partnership with the Northern Rangelands Trust. It shows community conservancies in northern Kenya and fractional cover, vegetation condition, and rainfall for historical periods.

Input animations for the Dashboard are produced in a [Notebook](https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-direct-access/blob/nrt/Use_cases/NorthernRangelandsTrust/NorthernRangelandsTrust.ipynb/) in the deafrica-direct-access repository.
